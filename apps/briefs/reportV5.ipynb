        "**Explanation of Output Components:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`[Story Identifier]`:** Create a concise, descriptive label for the story thread (max 4-5 words). Examples: `US-Venezuela: Deportations`, `Gaza: Ceasefire Collapse`, `UK: Economy Update`, `AI: Energy Consumption`. Use keywords representing the main actors and topic.\n",
        "2.  **`[Inferred Status]`:** Based *only* on the tone and content of the discussion *within the provided brief*, infer the story's current state. Use one of: `New`, `Developing`, `Escalating`, `De-escalating`, `Resolved`, `Ongoing`, `Static`.\n",
        "3.  **`[Key Entities]`:** List the 3-5 most central entities (people, organizations, countries) mentioned *in the context of this specific story* within the brief. Use comma-separated names. Example: `Trump, Maduro, US, Venezuela, El Salvador`.\n",
        "4.  **`[Core Issue Snippet]`:** Summarize the absolute essence of *this story's main point or development as covered in the brief* in **5-10 words maximum**. This requires extreme conciseness. Example: `Deportations resume via Honduras amid legal challenges`, `Ceasefire over, hospital strike, offensive planned`, `Talks falter, missile strike during meeting`.\n",

        "**Instructions & Constraints:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Process Entire Brief:** Read and analyze the *whole* brief to identify all distinct major stories. Stories under `<u>**title**</u>` headings are primary candidates, but also consider distinct, significant themes from other sections (e.g., a recurring topic in 'Global Landscape').\n",
        "*   **One Line Per Story:** Each identified story must correspond to exactly one line in the output, following the specified format.\n",
        "*   **Strict Conciseness:** Adhere strictly to the format and the word limit for the `[Core Issue Snippet]`. This is critical.\n",
        "*   **Focus on Coverage:** The goal is to capture *what was discussed*, not the full nuance or analysis.\n",
        "*   **Inference for Status:** You must *infer* the status based on the brief's content, as it's not explicitly stated per story in the input brief text.\n",
        "*   **No Extra Text:** Do **NOT** include any headers, explanations, introductions, or conclusions in your output. Output *only* the list of formatted strings.\n",
